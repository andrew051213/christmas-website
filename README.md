This is a Christmas website inspired by the design from Figma (view it [here](https://www.figma.com/design/ua1CGAKXNppOxErl5BQwRq/Design-in-Figma---Responsive-christmas-website-(Community))). I created only the red version, as I didn't get around to implementing the light theme. This project is one of my first websites built with Next.js, so the code may not be perfect. I'm open to any criticism or feedback to help improve my skills!
