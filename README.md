Christmas Website based on this figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/ua1CGAKXNppOxErl5BQwRq/Design-in-Figma---Responsive-christmas-website-(Community)?node-id=51-486&node-type=frame&t=gExkPSKulOoSgTOO-0, i made only the red version, i was too lazy to implement the light theme too. It's one of my first website made in NextJS so the code might not be perfect.
